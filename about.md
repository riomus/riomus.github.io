I am award winning PhD candidate in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I started my adventure with computers at the age of 2. My first software worked when I was 13. I received master's diploma with distinctions at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology. My scientific expertise is broad and covers multiple machine learning topics like natural language processing, computer vision. Besides working for numerous startups as a full-stack developer, I was also a software architect at Nokia. I am passionate about software craftsmanship and modern approaches for software development. In free time, besides learning esoteric programming languages, I study state of the art machine learning methods and practice software development.

Initiatives that I am taking part in:
