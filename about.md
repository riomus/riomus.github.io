## 👨‍💻 About Me

Award-winning **researcher in Artificial Intelligence**, entrepreneur, and passionate software developer. My journey with computers began at age 2, and by 13, I created my first working software. I hold a master's degree (with distinctions) in Artificial Intelligence from Wroclaw University of Science and Technology. My expertise spans **machine learning** (natural language processing, computer vision) and modern software engineering.

Besides working for numerous startups as a **full-stack developer**, I’ve served as a software architect at Nokia. I enjoy learning esoteric programming languages and continuously studying the state-of-the-art in machine learning methods.
